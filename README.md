# Oil-reserve-prediction-and-optimization
The project was implemented using reservoir data containing oil well parameters for some selective basins, using machine learning and statistical techniques we analyze the reservoir data and predicted new reserves in the well at the same time optimizing the placement to maximize the profits. An extensive exploratory data analysis was carried out and missing data were dealt with seaborn, NumPy and matplotlib. The project uses linear regression and neural networks to predict the results with 37.58, 0.89 & 40.03 as RMS errors over the 3 regions.
